### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ken**, currently a junior majoring in **BS Management Information Systems** at the Ateneo de Manila University.

As an aspiring **software engineer**, I've sought out opportunities that I've felt would enable me to grow and learn more about what it really takes to pursue a career in this field.

For one, I'm currently the **Associate Vice President for Systems Documentation** at my home organization, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ateneo.MISA/" target="_blank">Ateneo MISA</a>, wherein I handle systems documentation procedures along with leading outsourced development projects for the organization.

Additionally, I've also taken the leap into the professional world as well, currently employed as a **Development Intern** at <a href="https://medgrocer.com/" target="_blank">MedGrocer</a>, wherein I am currently building and developing systems and websites related to medicine and healthcare.

You can get to know me even better through the following:
- View my <a href="https://kennethfranco.github.io/kennethfranco/" target="_blank">portfolio site</a>
- Read up on my <a href="https://kennethfranco.github.io/kennethfranco/francoResume.pdf " target="_blank">resume</a>
- Send me an <a href="mailto:kennethlaurenzfranco@gmail.com">email</a> or message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-laurenz-franco-162b94200/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>

Thank you, hope to hear from you soon!
