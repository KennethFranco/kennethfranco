## hi there!
I'm **Ken**, currently a senior majoring in **BS Management Information Systems** at the Ateneo de Manila University.

As an aspiring **software engineer**, I've sought out opportunities that I've felt would enable me to grow and learn more about what it really takes to pursue a career in this field.

For one, I've taken up multiple leadership postions closely related to software development at my home organization, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ateneo.MISA/" target="_blank">Ateneo MISA</a>, with my key experience mostly being related to my position as the **Associate Vice President for Systems Documentation** during my junior year. It was here wherein I handled systems documentation procedures along with leading outsourced development projects for other external organizations in the university, such as the development of the <a href="https://www.coamanila.com/">website for COA-M<a/>, which has since served as a place to showcase the different organizations of the universtiy as well as allow for students to contact and request for the organization's services when needed.

Additionally, I've also taken the leap into the professional world as well, previously taking up two internships at two uniquely different Philippines-based startups during my junior year. The first of these was at <a href="https://www.abakadastudios.com/" target="_blank">Abakada Studios</a>, as a **Web Development Intern**, wherein I was exposed to building different educational technologies for the company's clients. On the other hand, I was also employed as a **Development Intern** at <a href="https://medgrocer.com/" target="_blank">MedGrocer</a>, wherein I was given many opportunities in both developing systems and websites from scratch as well as adding features to their already existing applications, all of which were related to medicine and healthcare.
